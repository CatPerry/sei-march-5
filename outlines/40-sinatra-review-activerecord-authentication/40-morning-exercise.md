# Morning Exercise

Create two functions `smallest` and `largest` that accept an array as an argument that finds the smallest and largest element in the array respectively. Use the following starter code as a base:

```ruby
def smallest(array)
  # your code here
end

def largest(array)
  # your code here
end

test_array = [98, -43, 7, -2, 19, 240]

smallest(test_array) # -43
largest(test_array) # 240
```
