# Morning Exercise

## Write three functions in javascript named `combiner`, `summer` and `multiplier`.

1. The `summer` function accepts two integer arguments that are summed together and returned from the function.
2. The `multiplier` function accepts two integer arguments that are multiplied together and returned from the function.
3. The `combiner` function accepts two integer arguments.
    - These two arguments should be summed together (using `summer`)
    - These two arguments should be multiplied together (using `multiplier`)
    - The result of both of these operations should be returned in an array where the first element is the result of the `summer` function and the second element is the result of `multiplier` function.
